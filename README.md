## What I did here:
 - I have created an student Management system that makes CRUD operations(Create,view,update,delete).
 - I have created an contructor and by using loop statements completed the code.
 - By looping statements and user option selection the code works
 - And also i come across many issues like when i enter same id it accepted then I found a solution to get rid off it.
 - At the end the loop ends when user enter 5 or exit it exit.
